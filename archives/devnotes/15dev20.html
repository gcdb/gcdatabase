				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>1. Improvements to PvP</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>The team has received many opinions with regards to PvP.</p>

					<p>Among these opinions, we have noticed that there are a huge amount of dissatisfactions about the state of Geared PvP above everything else.</p>

					<p>Therefore, we are looking for improvements to make Geared PvP a more enjoyable experience for the players.</p>

					<p>We plan to add new matchmaking rules for <b>Challenger rank in Geared PvP</b>.</p>

					<p>Firstly, the Challenger rank matchmaking system will be based on the player's PvP points, and the matchmaking will search for opponents with similar points and perform the matchmaking in real time.</p>

					<p>Secondly, players with very high PvP points in Challenger rank will be matched with AI, so there will be less forfeit time in play. (note from GCDB: not entirely sure what this meant)</p>

					<p>Lastly, we will also introduce a system that rewards PvP points depending on the points of the opponent in the Challenger league.</p>

					<p>By changing the matching rules for Challenger rank and the amount of points earned, we are aiming to not match players that are on a winning streak with players that are on a loosing streak.</p>

					<p><b>These will be implemented in the next update.</b></p>

					<p>However, Geared PvP will need more than just updates to the matching rules. We will have to make fundamental improvements to PvP.</p>

					<p>In particular, we feel responsible to make PvP an enjoyable experience for all of our beloved players.</p>

					<p>For that, we are considering to introduce a seasonal system for Geared PvP.</p>

					<p>The season will last for 4 weeks each, and the top 100 players every week will earn season points. Season points will also be earned when winning in the Challenger's league.</p>

					<p>In addition, there will be special rules for every season, seasonal rules and buffs will be applied in every season. This is to have a fun and brand new PvP experience.</p>

					<p>For a fairer matchmaking system, we are also experimenting on tournaments and Championship season 2.</p>

					<p>We look forward to your active feedback so we can satisfy the players with a good Geared PvP experience as soon as possible.</p>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>2. Finally New Contents!</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">

					<div class="container pb-3 img-responsive" style="text-align: center; justify-content: center;">

					</div>

					<p>To players who are waiting on new contents: the Dev Team has been working on new contents since the last major content update.</p>

					<p>We will be introducing a new world raid event that will require 4 players to work together to defeat giant demons and magical beasts.</p>

					<p>In the Event World Raid, the leader will select the difficulty and form a raid group. Raid members will be fighting individually, taking down the shared HP of the demon/magical beast within a time limit.</p>

					<p>Of course, we have it planned to showcase how much damage each player have dealt to encourage some friendly competititon.</p>

					<p>For now, the World Raid will be introduced first as an event. We will gather feedbacks and make improvements to the rules and eventually make it a regular content for guild members and friend to enjoy.</p>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>3. Costume Growth System</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>For players aiming to be even stronger, we plan to introduce a system to grow all costumes of different rarities to become UR rarities. This way, you are able to equip your favourite costumes of lower rarity or some rarely used costumes while increasing your Combat Class (CP).</p>

					<p>Materials required for each part (head, body, weapon) of the costume growth will be obtainable upon clearing the different HELL raids. They will also be obtainable via the World Raid in the future.</p>
				</div>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>4. Changes Gacha Lineups</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>Every time a new character is introduced, they will be added to the permanent pool. With this system, it will be increasingly more difficult to obtain specific characters as more updates are rolled out.</p>

					<p>This is especially true for new players to the game. It will be hard to get specific characters.</p>

					<p>Given the current situation, we plan to separate the permanent character gacha and change the gacha lineup.</p>

					<p>After the lineup change, we plan to increase the rate of 3 different SSR characters every day so that players will have a better chance to obtain the desired characters.</p>

					<p style="color: #ff0000">※ The exisitng gacha tickets will be usable till 30th April (Thursday).<br>※ Details will be announced later.</p>
				</div>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>5. Improvements to Guild</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>Since the implementation of Guild system, we have heard the feedback that there is a lack of coop element.</p>

					<p>To allow players to enjoy Guild activities through cooperation and competition, we plan to add features that will promote these ideas.</p>

					<p>You will be able to register your own Combat Class (CP) within the guild, and you can check your Combat Class (CP) ranking against your own guild or against everyone.</p>

					<p>Another new feature is to be able to check the last week's Guild Boss ranking within the guild. There are various system updates to Guild that are planned.</p>

					<p>On the next Dev Note, we will be able to share with you the spotlight guild content update - Guild War (tentative naming).</p>
