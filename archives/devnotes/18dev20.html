				<h2 class="m-0">18th KOO P Dev Notes (14 April 2020)</h2>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>For this Dev Note, we are going to talk about the contents we will be adding soon and also contents slightly in the future.</p>

					<p>Contents that we are releasing soon are mainly: QOL updates, Knighthood contents and PVP play mode etc.</p>

					<p class="mb-0">Also, due to COVID-19, the operation team is taking preventive measures to stop the further spread of the virus, therefore there might be a possibility of update schedule changes or postponement. We will make announcement on Twitter if there are any changes.</p>
				</div>
				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>1. QOL Updates</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>A lot more contents have been added since the game's initial release and with that more playtime is required.</p>

					<p>We have noted that players might feel tired playing through the different contents.</p>

					<p>To address this issue, we plan to add a [Sweep Ticket] (GCDB: it's not implicitly mentioned that it'll be a skip ticket, I'll retitle it in the future if needed) feature to aid players in clearing contents that require a lot of repeats (Free Stages, SP Dungeon, Boss Battles etc) more efficiently.</p>

					<p>In addition, with regards to related items to the [Sweep Ticket], we are also considering a new sub content that will allow players to get items/gold by utilising unused heroes after a certain amount of time. (GCDB: I think it's something like sending heroes for "expedition" to get items in other games)</p>

					<p class="mb-0">To add on, we also plan to implement advance feature to automatically salvage unneeded gears and players will get the upgrade and awakening stones immediately when players are doing Gear Gacha.</p>

				</div>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>2. New Knighthood Content</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>To further unite and prove the strengths of the Knighthood, we are preparing a new content: Knighthood Battle] (tentative).(GCDB: I'll call it guild war because knighthood battle is too cringe)</p>

					<p>Selected top Knighthoods will participate in a league format for a certain period of time. We will adopt the RVR (Realm vs Realm) system.</p>

					<p>Guild War will first have a Beta release for the pre-season. After that, we will increase the number of participating Knighthoods.</p>

					<p>Also, we are trying to come up with a new season of Knighthood Boss but it will take some time as it is under development. We seek your kind understanding while waiting.</p>

					<p class="mb-0">In the meantime, the boss we had for Season 1 Knighthood Boss will make a return soon. Please look forward to that in April.</p>

				</div>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>3. Addition of PVP Contents and Ranking Rewards</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>A new type of PVP content is being developed.</p>

					<p>Players will be able to directly select an opponent and take over the opponent's rank  if the match is won. You will need to have a grasp of the opponent's team comp and come up with suitable strategies.</p>

					<p>We have also received a lot of questions regarding the Geared PVP reward for Season 2.</p>

					<p>The reward hero is not meant to be strong. That being said, you are only able to obtain the hero through ranking top in PVP. Therefore,  it is supposed to be a honorary collectible hero.</p>

					<p>Because of that, the reward was supposed to be sent after the season has ended, it was not supposed to be displayed publicly before the season ends. However, there was an error that displayed the reward instead.</p>

					<p class="mb-0">The collectible hero will change from time to time. We will fix the issue so when new seasonal rewards are introduced in the future, it will not be displayed in advance.</p>

				</div>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>4. Future Update Plans</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext mb-3" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>We will briefly talk about some of the plans we have for the future.</p>

					<p>Grand Cross has been continuously updated since its release.</p>

					<p>However, we still feel that there are a lot of room for improvement regarding the fun, the satisfaction, and motivation for continuing to play the game.</p>

					<p>In future updates, we will focus on "growth goal" that will precedes big new contents.</p>

					<p>To be more specific, we are going to add main contents that will require various types of battles. And tying to the content, it will be new character growth contents.</p>

					<p>We will try our best to keep the players motivated and experience the character's phases of growth with the new content. We are hoping to raise the satisfactory level of our players with the new contents.</p>

					<p>Update contents will be talked about in future Dev Notes.</p>

					<p class="mb-0">Note: we have cancelled the live broadcast in April due to health and safety concerns for the involved parties because of COVID-19. We are thinking of ways to deliver the broadcast in other possible ways.</p>
