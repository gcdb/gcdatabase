					<p>This Dev Note will mainly be on what we have been preparing for the 1st anniversary update.</p>

					<p>On the 4th June 2019, Grand Cross was released, and it is almost 1 year since then.</p>

					<p class="mb-0">We made it this far thanks to everyone's warm support. With our sincere gratitude, the first anniversary update is in preparation.</p>
				</div>
				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>1. Grand Cross 1st Anniversary Grand Festival</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>The event name we chose for the anniversary is [Grand Cross 1st Anni Grand Festival]. The Fes will last approximately 1 month, and it will comprise of various events to thank the players. And before the event actually kicks off, we will be having a pre-event Fes prepared on 21st May.</p>

					<p>Firstly, there will be a character released to commemorate the anniversary.</p>

					<p>The character will make his/her first appearance in the game, and will be obtainable via event. Let your imagination run wild predicting who will be dropping.</p>

					<p>In addition, Mr Nakaba Suzuki (mangaka of SDS) has kindly drawn another Demon for the game, and we will be holding another event boss battle with the demon. Mr Suzuki has also planted a surprise for the item that will be dropped from the event boss battle.</p>

					<p>With the first anniversary, we have prepared various rewards to alleviate some of the burden from character growth. As an event reward, you will be able to fully awaken 1 character of choice. We are also increasing the amount of growth material from events.</p>

					<p class="mb-0">In the latter half of the event, we will be having an event with a new concept - [Event Final Boss Battle]. Many rewards will be available to reduce the burden of equipment enhancement.</p>

				</div>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>2. New Content Updates</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>A new content that we are preparing is [Tower of Trials] (tentative name).</p>

					<p>Instead of repetitive plays, climbing the tower will require more strategies.</p>

					<p>The content aims to be focused more on enjoying and playing it your own way to achieve the goals with your own strategy.</p>

					<p>The team of [Tower of Trials] changes regularly and will be played out in a series. It will receive updates after its release.</p>

					<p class="mb-0">The new PVP mode [Grand Brawl] that was mentioned in the previous dev note is also appraoching the final stage of development, we aim to release it during the anniversary.</p>

				</div>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>3. QOL Changes to Existing Contents</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>Many players have given their feedback regarding the [Skip Ticket] that was added during the update on 29 April.</p>

					<p>Firstly, we will make it such that using [Skip Ticket] will still grant EXP to characters, as well as earning affection points. For costumes that are able to summon specific demon, although you are unable to summon the specific demon now, we plan to make that feature work when you are using the skip ticket after the update.</p>

					<p>We also planned to add a mission in [Patrol Dispatch] to allow players to get more skip tickets.</p>

					<p class="mb-0">Futhermore, we will improve on the inconvenience players have when cooking a dish.</p>
				</div>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>4.Regarding Knighthood Battle</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext mb-3" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>The beta version of the Knighthood Battle has had a lot of bugs and errors, we sincerely apologize to everyone who is participating in the beta.</p>

					<p>We believe that even the beta version should have been released with a high degree of completion, therefore, we regret to have disappointed a lot of players due to the errors.</p>

					<p>After the current season of beta ends, will be actively try to fix the issues and take players' feedback into improving the system. We will work hard towards releasing the official content with a high degree of completion.</p>

					<p>We would like to take this opportunity to once again express our sincerest gratitude towrads all the players who have supported the game throughout the year.</p>

					<p>We will continue to improve on the QOL, and push out various updates to make your journey in Britannia even more enjoyable.</p>
