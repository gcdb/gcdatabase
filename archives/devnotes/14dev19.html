				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>We want everyone to go into 2020 with a bang and so we have prepared a lot of gifts and new year events.</p>

					<p><b>[Event] New Year Login Bonus</b></p>
					<p>To commemorate the beginning of a new year, we will be giving out gems to all players for 3 days. Please visit the Boar Hat during the event.</p>

					<p><b>[Event] New Year Fortune Telling (Omikuji) Event</b></p>
					<p>We are going to have a fortune telling event for the players, and depending on the results, players will receive corresponding gifts.</p>

					</div>

					<p><b>[Event] [New Year Training Cave] Event</b></p>
					<p>After completing the regular [Training Cave], there will be a special new year cave that players will be able to earn gems, and various items such as awakening stone upon clearing.</p>

					<p><b>[Event] Event Hawk Pass</b></p>
					<p>With the new year, another improved Hawk Pass will be available.</p>
					<p>The new Hawk Pass will be opened for 2 weeks, with NORMAL having 25 levels and SPECIAL having 35 levels.</p>
					<p>Other well received events such as [Gear Breakdown Success Rate Up], [Character Level Up Rate Up], [Viezel Hammer Failure Rate 0%] will also see a comeback.</p>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>2. Movie - Prisoners of the Sky</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>The story for the movie will be added!</p>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>3. 2020 Grand Cross</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>A lot more content will be added in the year of 2020.</p>
					<p>First, we will be adjusting the current content.</p>
					<p>As mentioned in previous dev notes, we will be making improvements to Geared PvP.</p>
					<p>In addition, existing contents such as [Guild], [Raids], [Super Boss] will also receive improvements to make the gameplay more interesting.</p>
					<p>For example, we will implement achievement system to the contents, and make communication with other players a more enjoyable experience.</p>
					<p>And of course, we are also preparing the story of season 3 and Grand Cross's original story for all players to immerse in.</p>
					<p>To kick it off, we will be introducing the movie, Prisoners of the Sky. The story of Hawk and the sins will continue in 2020.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, on top of [Super Boss Battles], we also plan to gradually add more game modes to reward and challenge veteran players.</p>
					<p>How would it look like in Twigo's perspective during his fight with Meliodas?</p>
					<p>How difficult would it be if we can experience the "real" flower garden that we once battled in against Hendrickson?</p>
					<p>[Challenge! Main HELL Stage (temp name)] is in the making. In the future, 4 players will have to work together to defeat a giant demon.</p>
					<p>We are looking at how to play the game in multiple ways and trying to approach the game meaningfully.</p>
					<p>We are also actively hearing our players' voices for quality of life updates. And with that, we are going to add a team tab for HELL raids.</p>
					<p>As for powering up the gears, we will also make QoL updates so that it will be more convenient for the players.</p>
					<p>However, with new challenges and improvements there is the possibility of introducing new bugs, we are trying our best to take care and minimize the chances of that happening.</p>
					<p>We have already planned out the updates in 2020 even till the end of the year, please do look forward to it.</p>
					<p>We will strive our best in 2020, and bring even more fun to our players.</p>

					<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>4. Closing Off 2019</b></h4>
					<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
						<p>Since the game's release in summer 2019, many players were able to enjoy the game.</p>
						<p>Although I was excited to share new experience with the players, I have also noted that there are a lot more to work on.</p>
						<p>But even among all of this, I would love to thank everyone who cherished and nurtured Grand Cross with the encouragement and criticism.</p>
						<p>We would not be having the contents and the community without everyone's support.</p>
						<p>We will continue to value our players' opinions and deliver even more enjoyable contents to you.</p>
						<p>Thank you so much once again for spending 2019 with Grand Cross, and please continue to love Grand Cross in 2020.</p>
