                    <div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
                        <p>In order to continue providing the players with interesting gameplay and contents, the Dev Team of Grand Cross actively gathered and considered feedback from the players, and decided on the direction the game will be taking.</p>
                        <p>In addition, this does not only apply to new contents, improvement of existing contents is also on the priority of our testing.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, we have decided to improve on [Training Cave], [Guild] and [Super Boss Battle].</p>
                        <p style="color: #2890d8"><b>A. Improvements and Changes to [Training Cave]</b></p>
                        <p>We recognized that the team formation and settings are inconvenient to the players when playing [Training Cave]. To address on this issue, we would like to make the following improvements.</p>
                        <p><b>i. Saving of teams that have cleared the stage previously</b></p>
                        <p>It was inconvenient for players to change the team comp every time when entering the [Training Cave]. To eliminate the inconvenience, we are going to add a save function to save the teams that have previously cleared the same stage of the training cave.</p>
                        <p><b>ii. Improvement changes to the accessibility and efficiency of [Training Cave]</b></p>
                        <p>The charge cycle of [Training Cave Key] will be changed from 3 days to 5 days.</p>
                        <p>In place of the extended charge cycle, we are revising the reward quantity upon clearing the [Training Cave].</p>
                        <div class="container pb-3 img-responsive" style="text-align: center; justify-content: center;">
                            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/651399921689165844/655083302864158720/unknown.webp" style="max-width:100%; max-height:100%;" loading="lazy">
                        </div>
                        <p>In addition, we are also planning to adjust the [Phantom Opal] boss (the one that you fight your own team) difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Please take note that due to the cycle being changed and reward update after the update, the [Training Cave] will receive a reset after the update.</p>
                        <p>We will continue to make improvements so that the [Training Cave] will be more interesting.</p>
                        <p style="color: #2890d8"><b>B. Improvements to [Guild]</b></p>
                        <p>We recognize that we still have to put in more work to make [Guild] more dynamic.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the following changes to [Guild Boss Battle] are planned.</p>
                        <p><b>i. Changes regarding the display of the scoring system</b></p>
                        <p>We will improve on display the scoring system</p>
                        <p>After the update, you will be able to see the battle scores you gained in real time during the battle whenever you take an action.</p>
                        <p>To add on, a pop up will be added for you to check the battle scores you currently have, as well as the turns you have taken.</p>
                        <p><b>ii. Changes to the scoring system</b></p>
                        <p>The battle score distribution list will be changed weekly.</p>
                        <p>Unlike current guild boss where you can clear with the same strategy, you will have to explore more strategies to get more battle scores after the update.</p>
                        <p>In addition, to minimize the RNG factor in completing the mission, we will also be adjusting the missions.</p>
                        <p>Also, we will be adding the following scoring criteria:<br>
                        - Score added based on Combat Class (CP) before the battle<br>
                        - The greatest damage dealt to the boss during the battle</p>
                        <p>Moving forward, we will be implementing: individual ranking from the previous week, individual Combat Class (CP) ranking, registering of Combat Class (CP), guild Combat Class (CP) etc. We will also be introducing co-op battles for guild members to challenge together. We are working hard on it so everyone will be able to play it as soon as possible.</p>
                        <small>Note from GCDB: I'm not 100% sure on this , take this with a pinch of salt till the actual patch comes out :/</small>
                        <p class="pt-3" style="color: #2890d8"><b>C. Regarding [Super Boss]</b></p>
                        <p>[Super Boss Battle] is something that players are motivated to do.</p>
                        <p><b>i. [Super Boss Season 3] Merlin</b></p>
                        <p>Merlin will starring as the Super Boss in the next update.</p>
                        <p>Unlike before where we release the difficulties separately, this time, all 4 difficulties from Normal to Hell will be released together.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the number of attempts daily is adjusted from 3 times to 1 time, reducing the burden of attempting it daily.</p>
                        <p>The following changes will not take place in [Super Boss Season 3] yet, but a ranking system will be introduced after Season 3. Rewards and titles will be distributed according to the ranking.</p>
                        <p>We will continue to work on increasing the motivation of players by incorporating various scoring system and mechanisms.</p>
                        <p style="color: #2890d8"><b>D. Rules regarding skill usage when under inability effects (stunned/petrified/frozen)</b></p>
                        <p>We recognize that players are having trouble with not being able to use skill cards at all when units are under the effect of stun/petrify/freeze.</p>
                        <p>We are currently vetting through the adjustment of this rule to make it more appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, you will be able to select the skill from hand even when the character is under the effect of stun/petrify/freeze. This way, you will be able to use the skills in hand and refill up your hand with new cards next turn. This is currently going through testing.</p>
                        <p>Also, under the condition that you used [Cleanse] or [Debuff Removal], skills used by the ally under inability effect will be played out normally. This is also going through many testing.</p>
                        <p>We will conduct various tests and verifications to improve on the rules so that players will be satisfied.</p>
