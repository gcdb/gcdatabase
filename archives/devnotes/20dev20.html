			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>Today, Grand Cross has officially hit its 1 year anniversary.</p>

					<p>We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused due to bugs and errors, and we have been and will continue to reflect on our wrongdoings.</p>

					<p>However, for everyone who has enjoyed the contents that we worked hard to prepare, it serves as a huge motivation for us, and just like that, a year has passed in a blink of an eye.</p>				

					<p>Since the game's release, we have been dropping updates regularly with more and more contents. However, we recognize that having fun gameplay, achieving player satisfaction and sustainability, as well as short of motivation to play are still some of the areas for improvement.</p>

					<p>Our dev team is sincerely grateful to the players for your warm support for the course of the past one year.</p>

					<p>To respond to everyone's support, we will carry on listening in to the feedback via our official Twitter account.</p>

					<p>We will continue to strive in the future, and provide services that will satisfy players of Grand Cross, to celebrate the 5th and even 10th year anniversary.</p>

					<p class="mb-0">In this Dev Note, I will briefly explain the part 2 of the celebration.</p>

				</div>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>1. [Tower of Trials]</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<div class="container pb-3 img-responsive" style="text-align: center; justify-content: center;">
						<img src="https://7taizai.netmarble.jp/file/imgs/06679000.webp" style="max-width:100%; max-height:100%;" loading="lazy">
					</div>

					<p>As mentioned previously, we will bring in the [Tower of Trials] during the part 2 celebration.</p>

					<p>The [Tower of Trials] aims to keep the player's motivation to get stronger up high, and allows you to experience the growth of characters in a tower-type strategic gameplay.</p>

					<p>This is not a content that will require repeated gameplay, but more of achieving the goal with your own strategy. We plan to update the tower regularly.</p>

					<p>In addition, the [Tower of Trial] will allow you to acquire the material for the new growth system - [Super Awakening].</p>

					<p>[Super Awakening] takes one step further on top of the regular [Awakening], and you can use [Super Awakening Coins] dropped from the tower as the material.</p>

					<p>It is also possible to use [Platinum Coins], [Gold Coins] and [Silver Coins] to perform Super Awakening instead of using [Super Awakening Coins].</p>

					<p>In addition to that, the new PVP game mode [Grand Brawl] was initially targeted to release during the anniversary, but there are many areas that are not refined enough, therefore we apologize that it will take a while more to bring that in game.</p>

					<p class="mb-0">We still have special events lined up in the part 2 of the celebration, so please do look forward to that.</p>

				</div>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>2. Anniversary Thank You Box</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext mb-3" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>We have sent out a [Thank You Box] to all players and the code to unlock that is HAPPY1YEAR or happy1year.</p>

					<p class="mb-0">In the next Dev Note, I would like to tell everyone about more things and more complete announcements, as well as new collaboration.</p>

					<p>We also planned to add a mission in [Patrol Dispatch] to allow players to get more skip tickets.</p>
