				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>1. New Super Boss Battle and New Contents</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>The dev team has received feedback about the game's contents repeating the same format and it has not been interesting. Therefore, the team feels that this is the time for a fresh change.</p>

					<p>In 2020, the first major change that we are going to make is regarding [Super Boss Battle].</p>

					<p>Firstly, we are going to introduce the ranking system to [Super Boss] battle. Players will earn rewards according to the ranking and the rewards will be distributed at te end of the season. We hope that players will be able to challenge the hardest difficulty and earn various rewards.</p>

					<p>To do that, we will be introducing [Super Boss Battle] limited missions and battle score system.</p>

					<p>When you have entered the [Super Boss Battle], you will be able to see the list of missions, battle scores etc (GCDB: should be something like guild boss battle score).</p>

					<p>There are also changes to the battle content. This time round, we will be featuring 2 characters as bosses together - [Super Boss Battle - Meliodas and Elizabeth].</p>

					<div class="container pb-3 img-responsive" style="text-align: center; justify-content: center;">
						<img src="../../https://7taizai.netmarble.jp/file/imgs/080e22ed.png" style="max-width:100%; max-height:100%;">
					</div>

					<p>As promised in the previous Dev Note, the [Event World Raid] is already in the final stages of testing and will be announced soon.</p>

					<p>In addition, cosmetic upgrade material obtained from [HELL] raids will also be available as rewards in [Raid Clear Events] on the weekends.</p>

					<p>We are always open to feedback and players' voices and we work hard to make sure Grand Cross is able to bring enjoyment to the players.</p>

				</div>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>2. Valentine's Day Related Contents</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>There must be players who are thinking "isn't there too little events for Valentine's Day?". We are planning to add a lot of Valentine's Day related events.</p>

					<p>First of all, what's a Valentine's Day without cuteness overflowing? We are going to add cute and pretty Valentine's Day commemorative characters.</p>

					<div class="container pb-3 img-responsive" style="text-align: center; justify-content: center;">
						<img src="../../https://7taizai.netmarble.jp/file/imgs/125046bc.png" style="max-width:100%; max-height:100%;">
					</div>

					<p>The Valentine's Day characters will have both visual and functional effects. The unit might be one of the key units for this [Super Boss Battle].</p>

					<p>We hope that the character will be enjoyed by the players.</p>

					<div class="container pb-3 img-responsive" style="text-align: center; justify-content: center;">
						<img src="../../https://7taizai.netmarble.jp/file/imgs/69c5223b.png" style="max-width:100%; max-height:100%;">
					</div>

					<p>Next, Valentine's Day themed [Boar Hat] decoration will be added directly to the boar hat too. This time the decorations boast bright and cute colors, as well as high calories.</p>

					<p>In addition, [Friend Coin] icon will also be changed for a limited time to match the Valentine's Day season. Also, maximum amount of friend coins per day per friend will be increased to 30.</p>

				</div>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>3. Story Event Renewal</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>Many players have given the feedback taht they are unable to easily locate the various events that are taking place and it was difficult for players to know where to start. To tackle this, for the future events, the story events will be presented in different episodes.</p>

					<p>In the new event, stories for various characters will be told, examples of such will be [Valenty's Journey to Britannia] and the new [Rules of the Sins].</p>

					<p>In addition, the UI will also be changed for the new story event page. A [Nightmare] mode specially made for story events will also be added so players are able to challenge a higher difficulty. You can switch the difficulty by tapping the [Switch] button on the banner to change the difficulty of the event. [Nightmare] mode will grant you better rewards!</p>

					<div class="container pb-3 img-responsive" style="text-align: center; justify-content: center;">
						<img src="../../https://7taizai.netmarble.jp/file/imgs/7c5fb62c.png" style="max-width:100%; max-height:100%;">
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4 style="color: #2890d8" class="p-3 whitetext"><b>4. Others</b></h4>
				<div class="greytheme whitetext mb-3" style="padding: 0.5rem 1rem;">
					<p>A lot of players are enjoying the new seasonal rules to Geared PvP. However, we are going to implement a more rational matching system in Season 2 of the Geared PvP in March. More interesting rules will also be introduced.</p>

					<p>Furthermore, [Achievements] and title system are also added so players will earn titles and rewards from the Geared PvP season 2.</p>

					<p>[Achievements] are also categorized into upper class and lower class. Completing all achievements from both classes wil grant player a unique title.</p>

					<p>Completing achievements in the upper class category wil grant player special features (such as buffs) in additional to the titles that can be earned.</p>

					<p>As for the other changes, we plan to add a recommended team section for players who are having trouble with certain stages, such as Demon Hendrickson in chapter 6. Players will then have a better grasp of what characters are suited to bring into the stage.</p>
